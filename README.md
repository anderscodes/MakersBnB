# MakersBnB
  
  Makers BnB is a project that we completed during our time at Maker's. The challenge was to create a AirBnB clone where a user could log in, post a property with details about the property (including availability) and browse other properties that were available to rent. 
  The project was completed in Node with express to handle the routes, EJS as a templating engine, sequelize as an ORM for our database and Cypress for testing. 
  The project was a week long and there were four people on our team. This was our first project that was solely in JavaScript after five weeks of Ruby and as such was a chance to get to know Node and express in particular.
